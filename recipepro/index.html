                    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
                    <div>
                    
                         1/2 cup Maida (All Purpose Flour)
                            1 cup grated Mawa (Khoya)(approx. 200-225 gms)
                            1/8 teaspoon Baking Soda
                            Ghee (or oil), for deep frying
                            3-4 Green Cardamoms or 1/4 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi Powder)
                            8-10 Saffron Strands (kesar)
                            1½ cups Sugar
                            2½ cups Water   
                </div>
            <!-- </div> -->
                    <br>
                    <h3>PROCESS</h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Prepare 1 cup mawa by following the recipe given above or use readymade mawa. Crumble it using hand or grate it using a grater. Add 1/8 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 cup sifted maida.</li>
                        <li>Mix them gently using a spoon.</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li> the flour is easily mixed with mawa because of moisture in mawa.
                        </li>
                        <li>Knead all of them together until smooth dough is prepared. If required add a few teaspoons of milk to knead a smooth and soft dough (add one teaspoon milk at a time until smooth consistency of dough is achieved, do not add large amount in single go).
                        </li>
                        <li>Divide dough into 16-18 equal parts, grease hands with ghee and make smooth surfaced balls from it. Make sure that there is no crack on the surface of balls because it will make jamuns to crack open while deep frying. If you are not able to form crack-less balls, then you need to make dough bit softer. To do this, add milk in dough, knead it again and roll the balls again. Do not make very large balls because they will increase in size after deep frying and soaking in syrup.
                        </li>
                        <li>Heat ghee or oil (or 1/2 ghee and 1/2 oil) in a pan over medium flame. When ghee is medium hot, add a pinch of dough in hot ghee and if it comes upward immediately without changing it’s color, ghee is ready. If it turns brown immediately, ghee is too hot. If it doesn’t come upward, ghee is cold. Add prepared dough balls (4-6 at a time or depending on the size of a pan) and deep-fry them over low to medium flame. As you can see they will turn light golden and increase in size after a minute. If the jamuns turn dark brown immediately then the temperature of ghee is too hot, pour some cold ghee in to ghee to reduce the temperature.</li>
                        <li>After 3-4 minutes, they will turn light golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Deep fry them until they turn golden brown, it will take around 6-7 minutes. Cooking them evenly is the key to soft and textured gulab jamuns, increase or decrease flame intensity to keep the temperature of ghee even while frying them.
                        <li>Add fried balls into warm sugar syrup (not hot syrup). If you add them into hot syrup, they will shrink in size.</li>
                            <li>Soak them for at least 1-2 hours before serving. As you can see in the picture, the jammuns are increased to almost double in size. Gulab jamuns are ready for serving. Serve them warm or chilled.
                            </li>
                    </ul>
